This program is NOT FINISHED and STILL BUGGY

This program is intended to allow the user to type in any location
and then select an airport or weather station near that location
to see the climatology of that location.

It gives the range of Highs and Lows for the location in the shaded
colors, and it does in solid lines the yearly daily highs and lows
for the hottest year on record to see how it compares with the regular
climatology.
